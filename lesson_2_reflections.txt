when we initialise a repository it starts tracking it???  it can start making committs??
we need to do it so that we can track it with commits

i think we need to use git add to specify and start git commits
i will add (git add) lesson_1_reflections.txt and lesson_2_reflections.txt at the same commit

staging area is different from the working directory, staging area is the list of files that we are going to commit???

Repository is the collection history of changes of a particular file (in snapshots ??)


Staging area is useful to make sure that I have one commit  per logical change.

git diff --staged shows the difference of staged data and commited data so i have the control of when i want to make a commit.

Branches eg are easy-mode  hard-mode  etc
Branches keep history organised and gives more manageability
I can be working on an experimental version on a separate branch and when ready merge that with master branch(now at another progressed state).

Diagrams simplify (understandable) the concept of branch structure

When we merge two branches together (in out case master and coins) we have added coins functionality to our game .
we represent it in the diagram like a branch coin being joined with master branch , we do it the way because coin functionality was independently developed by Sarah while master was also being further developed by caroline and doug??
