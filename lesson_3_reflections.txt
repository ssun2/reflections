creating a remote repository rather than keeping all my work at local.
kkkklllllll


Rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository I want to always pull changes manually because
I always want to check first what is the update and decide if I want to keep it or not.

Fork is different from clone because fork is the copied link from github to github and clone can be from github to local or local to local. 
in fork there is a link to the original author and we are unable to change the author's version but we can always put up our updated forked version.

Branch is a separate development branch in the local?? file??

the benefit of having last known state of the remote stored locally is 
the ability to compare the two versions and see the changes

I would want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master when 
I am proposing a change that I want/need my friends/colleages to collaborate in 
only after they see/review and we all agree on a change that I merge the branch into master(Before then it is better to be in a branch)
