creating a remote repository rather than keeping all my work at local.
kkkklllllll


Rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository I want to always pull changes manually because
I always want to check first what is the update and decide if I want to keep it or not.

Fork is different from clone because fork is the copied link from github to github and clone can be from github to local or local to local. 
in fork there is a link to the original author and we are unable to change the author's version but we can always put up our updated forked version.

Branch is a separate development branch in the local?? file??
