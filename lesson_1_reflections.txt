Git allows saving multiple files in 1 commit because I think it is built for version control systems so it is more robust ??

while Google Docs treat each file separately



hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart................

command git log shows the log of all the changes made to the file (author, time , change + color coded.......)

git diff enables to compare changes in two specified commits

using version control gives the peace of mind that in case making some changes break something , it is easy to revert back
